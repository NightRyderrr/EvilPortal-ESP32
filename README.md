# EvilPortal-ESP32


# why
I made this cause i didnt want to buy a wifi dev board for my F0


# how to install
you'll need:  
ESP32 dev board
microsd card with a creds.txt
microsd card reader  module

# How to use
Currently only instagram is suported, and its hard coded, but its coming.  
you'll want to change the SSID, something convincing that people wont get thrown off being asked for their instagram credentials


# TODO
sdcard pinouts  
add text file if it isnt deteced  
add other portals
